# Hangman
[View The Deployed Site Here](https://hangman-gamer-fa003c400c0e.herokuapp.com/)

## About
The concept of this application was to create an engaging game of hangman for the end-user using Python. 
The game will display the instructions depending on the level selected in the game. Easy mode for 3-letter words, medium mode for 5-letter words, and hard mode for 7-letter words.  
I opted to create the Python code using the programming paradigm, object-oriented programming, or O.O.P.
